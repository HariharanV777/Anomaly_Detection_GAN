This project leverages Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) to identify anomalies within sonar datasets, a common challenge in underwater exploration and monitoring. By training a GAN on normal sonar data, the model learns to reconstruct typical patterns. Anomalies are detected by evaluating reconstruction errors; significant deviations indicate potential irregularities in the sonar readings.

Key Features:

Unsupervised Learning: Utilizes only normal data for training, eliminating the need for labeled anomaly data.

High-Quality Reconstructions: GANs are adept at modeling complex data distributions, leading to accurate reconstructions of normal sonar patterns.

Effective Anomaly Detection: Anomalies are flagged based on reconstruction errors, facilitating early detection of potential issues.

Applications:

Marine Biology: Monitoring marine life and habitats.

Underwater Infrastructure: Inspecting underwater structures like pipelines and cables.

Environmental Monitoring: Detecting changes in underwater ecosystems.

This approach offers a robust solution for real-time anomaly detection in sonar data, enhancing the efficiency and safety of underwater operations.
